Through her travels, she gained a unique insight into the culinary secrets of the Persian kitchen, and the lives of ordinary Iranians today.&nbsp;<br>In&nbsp;<em>The Saffron Tales<\/em>, Yasmin weaves together a tapestry of stories from Iranian home kitchens with exclusive photography and fragrant, modern recipes that are rooted in the rich tradition of Persian cooking. All fully accessible for the home cook, Yasmin&#8217;s recipes range from the inimitable fesenjoon (chicken with walnuts and pomegranates) to kofte berenji (lamb meatballs stuffed with prunes and barberries) and ghalyieh maygoo (shrimp, coriander, and tamarind stew). She also offers a wealth of vegetarian dishes, including tahcheen (baked saffron and eggplant rice) and domaj (mixed herb, flatbread, and feta salad), as well as sumptuous desserts such as rose and almond cake, and sour cherry and dark chocolate cookies.&nbsp;<br>With stunning photography from all corners of Iran and gorgeous recipe images, this lavish cookbook rejoices in the land, life, flavors, and food of an enigmatic and beautiful country.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Saffron-Tales-Recipes-Persian-Kitchen\/dp\/1632867109\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546278841&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=persian+cookbooks&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=persiancookbook-20&amp;linkId=25924155ba58bd28c81bc17ff2c1b00e&amp;language=en_US\">Buy Now on Amazon for <img src=\"https:\/\/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/e\/ir?t=persiancookbook-20&l=alb&o=1&a=1632867109\" width=\"1px\" height=\"1px\" alt=\"\" style=\"position: fixed !important; bottom: -1px !important; right: -1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winner of the M.F.K Fisher Award for Excellence in Culinary Writing from Les Dames d&#8217;EscoffierNew York Times Best Cookbooks of the YearWall Street Journal&nbsp;Best Cookbooks of the YearBBC Food Programme&nbsp;Best Cookbooks of the Year A glorious celebration of the food and people of Iran, featuring stories from home kitchens and more than 80 delicious, modern&#8230; <\/p>\n<div class=\"link-more\"><a href=\"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/the-saffron-tales-recipes-from-the-persian-kitchen\/\">Read More<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":83,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","spay_email":""},"categories":[13],"tags":[8,14],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/the-saffron-tales-cover.jpg","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pdmqWG-1k","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/82"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=82"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/82\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":149,"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/82\/revisions\/149"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/83"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=82"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=82"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/persiancookbook-clone.mystagingwebsite.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=82"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
